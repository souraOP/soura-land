# SouraLand! - A Retro Pip-Boy Themed Chat App

Welcome to **SouraLand!**, a real-time chat application with a unique, immersive UI inspired by the Pip-Boy from the Fallout video game series. This isn't just a messaging app; it's a retro-futuristic experience complete with a phosphor screen aesthetic, scanlines, goofy sound effects, and a chaotic personality.

## Features

* **Chat in Real-Time!** Thanks to Google's Firestore, your messages show up instantly for everyone. No more hitting the refresh button!

* **Know Who's Hanging Out!** The online user list updates right away when your friends hop on or off the chat. It's all live, adding to the fun.

* **Pick Your Own Name!** You can set a custom username to show off your personality. The app will even remember it for next time, so you don't have to set it again.

* **Get That Awesome Pip-Boy Feel!** We went all out to make the UI look and feel just like the real thing:
    * **Authentic Theme:** It's got that classic green-on-black screen that's easy on the eyes and super nostalgic.
    * **CRT Effects:** We've added animated scanlines and glowing text to give it that old-school CRT monitor vibe.
    * **Interactive Elements:** You can click on tabs, see system lights blink, and check out the fun HP/AP bars at the bottom. It really feels like you're using a piece of retro tech!
    * **Boot-Up Sequence:** When you first open the app, you'll get a cool boot-up sequence with sound effects to get you right into the mood.

* **Hear the Beeps and Boops!** We've added retro sound effects for everythingâ€”sending messages, getting new ones, clicking buttons, and even starting up the app. It makes everything feel more fun and interactive.

* **Get Ready for Some Chaos!** There's a "System Anomaly" panel that shows random, hilarious Bengali slang jokes. It's our little way of keeping things interesting and a bit troll-worthy!

* **Chat Anywhere!** The app works great on both your computer and your phone. The layout changes to fit your screen, so it's always easy to use, no matter where you are.

* **Easy Cleanup for the Owner!** If you're running the app, you can easily delete all the messages from the Firebase console if you ever need to start fresh.
